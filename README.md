This repository contains a [pkg](www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/pkg/) version of the original
[Planet package](http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=miniKanren.plt&owner=dfriedman)
of minikanren by Dan Friedman.

This package additionally includes Scribble documentation.

Installation:
  * `raco pkg install minikanren`

For practical uses, take a look at [cKanren](https://github.com/calvis/cKanren) instead.
It extends miniKanren with better Racket integration and support for constraint programming.

Also see the canonical [minikanren](https://github.com/miniKanren/Racket-miniKanren) repository.
